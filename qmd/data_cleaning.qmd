## Data Cleaning

Bioinformatics tools are very strict about filenames, sample IDs, and metadata.

Even one wrong character can:

-   break pipelines

-   mismatch samples

-   cause failed downstream analyses (e.g. DESeq2, Seurat)

-   make reproducibility impossible

So, we require **standardized naming**.

## ❌ Common Naming Problems

List of common **errors** found in file names metadata:

-   Duplicate sample names (e.g., `sample1` appearing twice)

-   Greek characters (`α`, `β`, `Α`, `Τ`)

-   Spaces in names (`Sample 1`, `Control rep 2`)

-   Special characters (`!`, `%`, `@`, `#`, `(`, `)`, `/`)

-   Different names for the same sample (`CTRL1`, `Ctrl1`, `control_1`)

## ✅ Naming Rules

Sample names **MUST**:

-   use English letters **only**

-   **never** change file names between FASTQ - metadata - results

-   use only letters, numbers, and underscores **(A–Z, a–z, 0–9, \_)**

    ✔ `A01_Rep1`

    ❌`A01-Rep(1)`

-   unique names

-   be consistent across files and folders

## 📄 Project Documentation (The README file)

Standardized names are only useful if we know the context of the project. To prevent the loss of critical project details (who did what a year later), every project folder **MUST** contain a `README` file.

### Recommended Template

Create a file named `README.txt` in your main project folder and use this structure:

**Project:** Short Title

**Project owner:** Name

**Bioinformatician:** Name

**Date Started:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Status:** In Progress / Completed / Archived

**Experimental Details:** A brief description with the contex of the project (e.g. Comparisons, Groups)
