## Data Cleaning

Bioinformatics tools are very strict about filenames, sample IDs, and metadata.

Even one wrong character can:

-   break pipelines

-   mismatch samples

-   cause failed downstream analyses (e.g. DESeq2, Seurat)

-   make reproducibility impossible

So, we require **standardized naming**.

## ❌ Common Naming Problems

List of common **errors** found in file names metadata:

-   Duplicate sample names (e.g., `sample1` appearing twice)

-   Greek characters (`α`, `β`, `Α`, `Τ`)

-   Spaces in names (`Sample 1`, `Control rep 2`)

-   Special characters (`!`, `%`, `@`, `#`, `(`, `)`, `/`)

-   Different names for the same sample (`CTRL1`, `Ctrl1`, `control_1`)

## ✅ Naming Rules

Sample names **MUST**:

-   use English letters **only**

-   **never** change file names between FASTQ - metadata - results

-   use only letters, numbers, and underscores **(A–Z, a–z, 0–9, \_)**

    ✔ `A01_Rep1`

    ❌`A01-Rep(1)`

-   unique names

-   be consistent across files and folders
